# Project Overtime
Custom clock that manipulates time; makes it better for me. Code only valid for toronto currently. 

There are 60 hours in a day, with 60 mins in each hour with 24 seconds per minute. More time. Moves faster. Mathematically sound. Inspired by ancient Indian clocks. 

customclock updated with 4th iteration.
- sunrise to sunrise is a day
- console cleared. clock printed on the same line every time.
- updated math logic for clock running from 00:00 to current time.
  
Work under progress...
